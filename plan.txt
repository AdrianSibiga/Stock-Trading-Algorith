1. Web scraping:
    Grab the data from the column in open insider and store all the different cluster buys along with their corresponing data together

2. Grabbing stock history
    Before I was going to use excel, but a better idea is to use a python library that can do it all for me and reduce the headache
    with automating the excel csv conversion stuff

3. Performing analysis on the data
    Probably the most tedious part. After we get the stock data, we will need to perform some math to determine correlations. 
    Don't really know about what to do with that yet
