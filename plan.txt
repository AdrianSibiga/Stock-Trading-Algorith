1. grab the data from the column in open insider and store all the different cluster buys along with their corresponing data together

2. grab stock history from using an excel function with the specific dates that the cluster buy was done. 
   and turn it into a csv to be able to read it using python. Problem is how do I turn it into a csv automatically?

3. After we get the stock data, we will need to perform some math to determine correlations. Don't really know about what to do with that yet
